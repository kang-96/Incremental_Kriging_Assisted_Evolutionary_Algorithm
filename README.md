# Incremental_Kriging_Assisted_Evolutionary_Algorithm
This is the MATLAB implementation of the incremental Kriging-assisted evolutionary algorithm proposed in [1]. It uses an incremental learning method to update the Kriging model when new samples become available. Therefore, the surrogate modelling process is significantly faster than the traditional learning method.
